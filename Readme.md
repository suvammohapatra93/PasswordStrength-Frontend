# Password Strength App

This is a simple web application to check the strength of your password. The app evaluates the password's strength based on multiple criteria and provides real-time feedback and suggestions to improve its security.

## Features

### 1. Password Strength Indicator

The app evaluates the strength of the entered password based on the following factors:

- Password length
- Inclusion of uppercase letters
- Inclusion of numbers
- Use of special characters (e.g., `@`, `#`, `$`, etc.)

Based on these criteria, the password strength is classified into the following categories:

- `Very Weak`
- `Weak`
- `Medium`
- `Strong`

### 2. Password Suggestions

When the password is weak or medium, the app provides useful suggestions for improving its strength. These suggestions may include:

- Increasing the password length
- Adding uppercase letters
- Including numbers
- Using special characters

### 3. Real-time Feedback

As the user types their password, the app dynamically updates the password strength and suggestions in real-time, making it easy to understand the necessary improvements.

### 4. Password Visibility Toggle

A toggle button next to the password field allows the user to switch between showing and hiding the password. This feature is especially useful for confirming the password's correctness during entry.
